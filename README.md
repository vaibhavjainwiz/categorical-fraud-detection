# Fraud Detection With Categorical XGBoost

This example notebook shows how to train and deploy an XGBoost model
with categorical features in Triton using the FIL backend. We begin by training
two separate models on a fraud detection dataset with categorical variables:
one small model designed to maximize runtime performance and one larger model
designed to maximize accurate and precise detection of fraud. We then deploy
both models on CPU and GPU and compare their performance using Triton's
`perf_analyzer`. Based on these results, we see that GPU deployment opens up
the possibility of deploying a much larger and more accurate fraud model with
higher throughput while also keeping to a tight latency budget.

## Running the notebook
In order to launch the Triton server, you will need
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system. The
rest of the notebook also requires a few Python dependencies. To easily install
these additional dependencies, you may make use of the provided conda
[environment
file](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/fil_backend/tree/main/notebooks/categorical-fraud-detection/environment.yml)
as follows:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
You may then activate the conda environment and run the notebook as usual:
```bash
conda activate triton_example
jupyter notebook
```
The Jupyter interface should now be accessible from a browser, and you can
follow the instructions within the notebook itself from there.
